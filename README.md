This is a meme Subway Surfer clone that I've made whilst learning Unity

Game about an in-joke for my friends. I've learned a lot in the process of making this weird game both in Unity and Blender.

P.S. Beware - There's a skin-changing menu in the game that isn't quite working (the menu is actually working, but you can't change the skin). Still haven't found the time to fix it.

Also, the download link for the game is here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KfmslIx7pxcBltZAtEBm3HSDtgQkZ3MG/view?usp=share_link
